/*This code will let you play rock paper scissors with a computer pseudo randomly picking rock paper or scissors. It will take a user input as a string and convert the inputed string to an int 0-2. The computer will randomly generate an int from 0-2. 0 is rock, 1 paper, 2 scissors. 
There are 9 possibilities: 3 ties, 3 wins, 3 losses.The final if statement is divided into 3 parts. 
FIRST will test tie condtions seeing if user int and computer int are equal. 
SECOND will test win conditions for user. 
THIRD will default the last 3 probabilities to a lose condition. */
